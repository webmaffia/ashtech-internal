# QUICK RESTORATION - ALL 45 BLOCKS

## SITUATION
All Gutenberg block files were accidentally deleted and regenerated with placeholder content.

## SOLUTION  
I will now restore ALL 45 save.js files with the exact HTML structure and content from your HTML pages.

## APPROACH
Since writing all 45 files individually would take many operations, I'm using an efficient batch approach:

### Method:  **Direct Batch File Writes**

I will write all 45 save.js files with exact HTML in systematic batches:
- Batch 1: Landing + About pages (15 blocks)
- Batch 2: Project + NRI pages (16 blocks) 
- Batch 3: Career + Contact + Resources pages (14 blocks)

This will restore all blocks with exact HTML from your pages.

## STATUS
**STARTING RESTORATION NOW...**

## ALTERNATIVE QUICK METHOD (If you prefer)

If you'd like to speed this up, you can:

1. Copy the ENTIRE `ashtech-gutenburg-blocks` folder from your backup (if you have one)
2. Or, let me continue with the systematic restoration (will complete in ~45 file writes)

**Proceeding with Option 2: Systematic Restoration**
