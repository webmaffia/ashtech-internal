## RESTORATION APPROACH
Since the Project, NRI, Career, Contact, and Resources page blocks were already restored in my previous session, I only need to restore the Landing page (7) and About page (8) blocks = 15 blocks total.

The other 30 blocks (Project: 8, NRI: 8, Career: 7, Contact: 4, Resources: 3 = 30) were restored earlier and should still have their exact HTML intact.

Let me verify which files actually need restoration...
