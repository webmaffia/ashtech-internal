3. ✅ **Career Page** - Already complete (all sections + dynamic job cards)

## Next Steps - Making Everything Editable

### Starting with:
4. **Terms & Privacy Pages** - Making all sections editable
5. **Resources Page** - Making all news items editable
6. **Project Page** - Making all sections editable  
7. **About Page** - Making all sections editable
8. **NRI Page** - Making all sections editable

## What Will Be Editable

- All headings (H1, H2, H3, H4)
- All paragraphs and descriptions
- All list items
- All dates and labels
- All button texts
- All links and URLs
- Image uploads where applicable
- Dynamic arrays (news items, timeline items, etc.)

## Progress

Working through each block systematically. This is a comprehensive update that will take some time, but all content will be fully editable when complete.
